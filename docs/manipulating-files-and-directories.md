##`cp` -- Copy Files and Directories

The `cp` command copies files or directories. It can be used two different ways:

```cp item1 item2```

to copy the single file or directory *item1* to file or directory *item2* and:

```cp item... directory```

to copy multiple items (either files or directories) into a directory.

###`cp` Options

|Option|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`-a, --archive`| Copy the files and directories and all of their attributes, including ownerships and permissions. Normally, copies take on the default attributes of the user performing the copy.|
|`-i, --interactive`| Before overwriting an existing file, prompt the user for confirmation. <br>**If this option is not specified, `cp` will silently overwrite files.**|
|`-r, --recursive`| Recursively copy directories and their contents. This option (or the -a option) is required when copying directories.|
|`u, --update`|When copying files from one directory to another, copy only files that either donâ€™t exist or are newer than the existing corresponding files in the destination directory.|
|`-v, --verbose`|Display informative messages as the copy is performed.|
